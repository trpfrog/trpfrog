# Hello World! üé∫üê∏

I'm tsmami („Å§„Åæ„Åø, trpfrog).

I ***was*** conducting research on natural language processing using deep learning at the University of Electro-Communications
(Undergraduate School).

I completed my Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) degree and am now working as **a web engineer**.

As a hobby, I also engage in **web development** (React/Next.js).
